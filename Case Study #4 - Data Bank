A. Customer Nodes Exploration
1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT node_id)
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes;

2. What is the number of nodes per region?
SELECT
  r.region_name, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT cn.node_id) AS node_count
FROM data_bank.regions r
JOIN data_bank.customer_nodes AS cn
  ON r.region_id = cn.region_id
GROUP BY r.region_name;

3. How many customers are allocated to each region?
SELECT r.region_name,
       count(c.customer_id) AS count_cus
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes c
JOIN data_bank.regions r ON c.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY r.region_name
ORDER BY count_cus;

4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
WITH node_days AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    node_id,
    end_date - start_date AS days_in_node
  FROM data_bank.customer_nodes
  WHERE end_date != '9999-12-31'
  GROUP BY customer_id, node_id, start_date, end_date
) 
, total_node_days AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    node_id,
    SUM(days_in_node) AS total_days_in_node
  FROM node_days
  GROUP BY customer_id, node_id
)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(total_days_in_node)) AS avg_node_reallocation_days
FROM total_node_days;

B. Customer Transactions
1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?
SELECT txn_type,
       count(DISTINCT customer_id) AS transactions,
       sum(txn_amount) AS SUM
FROM data_bank.customer_transactions c
GROUP BY txn_type;

2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?

WITH cte AS
  (SELECT customer_id,
          COUNT (customer_id) AS avg_count,
                avg(txn_amount) AS avg_amount
   FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
   WHERE txn_type = 'deposit'
   GROUP BY customer_id)
SELECT round (avg(avg_amount)) AS avg_amount_des,
       round (avg(avg_count)) AS avg_count_des
FROM cte;
